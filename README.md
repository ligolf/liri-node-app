Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface

OK.  I managed to get all of the movie-this code to work.  I was also able to get the do-what-it-says code to work.  I was able to get all of the API-s working however I was only able to get the .env file to work with Spotify.  the others I had to insert the keys into the js file.  I was also having a difficult time getting the api's to display correctly.  I was also able to get the log.txt file to record all entries made.  I had concert-this working to an extent but now it is no longer working.
